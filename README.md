This repository contains an Ada program designed to check if a given integer is a prime number.  However, the initial implementation contains a bug that leads to incorrect results for certain inputs.  The `bug.ada` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.ada` provides a corrected version.  This example highlights a common issue in prime number algorithms where edge cases or optimization attempts may introduce errors.
